                            <li>All clients are required to fill out this form to be considered/entered into the queue: <a href="https://xiran-art.netlify.app/" class="text-color-link">xiran-art.netlify.app/</a></li>
                            <li>Requests (free art) are not commissions (paid art). I don't take requests. Sorry. Art is a luxury, not a necessity; I am not obligated to accept.</li>
                            <li>If you saw a style in my gallery that you do not see listed here, select "Other" in the form & let's see what we can do.</li>
                            <li>My art style is subject to change from one piece to the next & I reserve the right to artistic freedom & interpretation.</li>
                            <li><b>You are responsible for archiving the art once I deliver it to you. I routinely clear out my storage.</b></li>
                            <li>Finished art will be provided via our main source of communication [Discord/Note/DM, etc.] and your PayPal email. You will receive .JPG/.JPEG file(s) unless you explicitly state that you require an image with transparency (.PNG). Emotes will be sent as .PNG files. By default, my drawings will have a gray background. You may ask for another flat color in the form if you desire.</li>
                            <li>I usually provide a WIP at the sketch, flat colors, and background flats stages.</li>
                            <li>You can ask for changes during the WIP stages, however, there are limits. <b>I will charge you for extensive revisions</b> (see below). If I make an error due to misinterpreting poor references or unclear/incomplete descriptions, I am not required to make corrections. Be clear with your requests and make sure everything is in the price quote I send to you.</li>
                            <li>Sketch stage: corrections for blatant errors/missing items | Flat colors stage: corrections for smaller details (like accessories or incorrect base colors | Background flat stage: corrections for color ONLY.</li>
                            <li>If I'm unsure of what you want, I'll doodle out a stick figure sketch, and if you like it, we'll work from there.</li>
                            <li><b>Please don't waste my time.</b> Do not expect me to re-draw entire scenes for free after you approve of the initial sketch! <b>I will charge you for extensive revisions based on what was completed and what you ask me to draw.</b> For example, if you ask me for a colored sketch scene where two characters are sitting back to back, I doodle them out (you give me the green light to continue working), complete the sketch in its entirety, and then you ask me to draw those same characters in a completely different pose or angle, I will offer to either continue working with the first sketch towards the colored sketch goal, or redraw the whole scene & color it, but you are required to pay for both the initial sketch and for the colored sketch as they will be considered two separate drawings. Small changes, like facial expressions, are fine as long as they happen before I start adding color, and, as long as you don't abuse my good will.</li>
                            <li>Avoid uploading the unwatermarked versions publicly (where anyone may access it) if you don't want them stolen/reposted by randoms. Unless a commission is strictly private (see below), I reserve the right to post a full resolution (albeit watermarked) to a VIP discord channel for my Twitch Subscribers.</li>
                            <li><b>Do not rush or harass me.</b> Please. I have a life outside of drawing commissions. If you have not heard from me in 7 days, you are welcome to inquire about what's going on.</li>
                            <li>By commissioning me, you affirm you're at least 18 years of age.</li>
                            <li>All non-human (i.e., furry, splatoon, etc.) characters will be given human proportions.</li>
                            <li>Tips are always welcomed & appreciated uwu</li>

                            <li><b>RUSH/PRIORITY:</b> skip the queue & skip the commission I'm currently working on. I will work on it ASAP, during every waking moment of my day to get it done as quickly as physically possible. The more people you skip, the more expensive it will be.</li>
                            <li><b>SKIP QUEUE:</b> skip the queue, but I will work on your commission after the current one is completed. This will not be done ASAP, I will work at my normal speed. The more people you skip, the more expensive it will be.</li>
                            <li><b>PRIVATE:</b> permanently kept off all my social media & out of my VIP discord channel for Twitch Subscribers. This will double the total cost of your commission. Fanart cannot be private.</li>
                            <li><b>Lewd art:</b> +15-25% </li>
                            <li><b>Character design:</b> 10-50% design fee, depending on my judgement of its complexity. Anything not explicitly described is entirely up to me. I strongly suggest opting for the doodle option when designing characters - while I do not allow edits on doodles, it will still be by far cheaper than having me make edits to a more complex style.</li>
                            <li>You <b>ARE</b> permitted to share my art on your social media if you credit/tag me appropriately & link back to <a href="https://xiran.carrd.co/" class="text-color-link">xiran.carrd.co/</a>. You <b>ARE</b> permitted to print out a copy and hang it on your wall or give it to a friend as a gift. You <b>ARE</b> permitted to have a print shop put it on your shirt. <b>All artworks are personal use only unless formally discussed prior to me sending the invoice.</b> </li>
                            <li>You are <b>NOT</b> permitted to sell, edit/modify, distribute, make merchandise, claim credit, or use my artwork for advertising (e.g. commercial usage). You are <b>NOT</b> permitted to sell my artwork at conventions or sell the digital full-resolution files - this includes (but is not limited to) Etsy/Gumroad type websites. You may <b>NOT</b> use it as part of an advertisement or in any way that will bring you income - this constitutes as COMMERCIAL WORK. </li>
                            <li><b>Logos, Banners, and other "channel-related artwork"</b> are considered commercial work. <b>Twitch/Discord emotes are an exception</b>, in which you are permitted to have them as Twitch subscriber rewards/benefits - the other rules mentioned earlier in this clause still apply.</li>
                            <li><b>Commercial work invokes a % fee</b>, and upon request, you will be provided with a formal document handing over the IP rights at the completion of the commission. This applies to individuals & firms alike. I will retain the right to provide my work as samples to future clients. Commercial work cannot be Private.</li>

                            <li>Listed prices are "minimum", base for simple character designs and poses; it's how much you would pay for your character in a plain T-shirt + pants + basic shoes in an idle position of my choice. Outfit complexity raises this price.</li>
                            <li>Character props like pets/props/weapons cost extra. Price depends on style & complexity of the item(s).</li>
                            <li><b>Commissions totaling $75.99 and below require full payment up front. If your commission is $76.00 or more, you can request the half payment method instead. </b></li>
                            <li>You must pay half of (or full) price up front. PayPal Only. Half payment will result in heavily watermarked ("Work in progress, not paid in full"), lower resolution previews/WIPs. This is to deter ghosting & theft. </li>
                            <li>Downpayment (i.e., 1/2 payment up front method), just like full payment, is non-refundable. </li>
                            <li>You have 48 hours to respond to me after I (attempt to) contact you that it's your turn in queue. If you are no longer interested or do not have the funds to proceed, you may ask to cancel or be put on hold while I move onto another person. I will approach you again every few weeks to ask if you're still interested. This process can be repeated indefinitely until you're the only person left in queue, at which point it will be your responsibility to contact me once you're ready.</li>
                            <li>You have 48 hours to make a payment after I send the invoice. If after 48 hours I do not receive payment or an update from you, I will cancel your commission.</li>
                            <li>Please do not send payment until after I accept your commission. <b>Any and all payments sent without my prior knowledge (and our mutual agreement) will be deemed as donations.</b></li>
                            <li>Prices are non-negotiable; do not ask me to adjust them to your budget. I always break down my pricing for more complex commissions, so if something's too expensive, you can remove specific portions.</li>
                            <li>If you think my price is unfair & believe I can finish your art for a cheaper price, you can request to pay 'by the hour', in which I set a timer that activates only when I draw. Please contact me for more details.</li>
                            <li><b>You may cancel only if you have not sent payment yet. Absolutely no refunds unless I cancel (at any point) from my end.</b></li>
                            <li>Unless your commission is strictly private, I reserve the right to display your commission on any of my social media/website/gallery/etc. and to make possible future profit off of your commission - e.g., artbooks/prints/advertising my art/Twitch/Social Media etc.</li>

                                Freelancer taxes in my area also cut off a good 35%-40% of my earnings.</li>

                            <li class="xiransindent">If NSFW, no. If SFW, yes, but it will have to wait until I'm done with my current drawings that are
