                            <li>Requests (free art) are not commissions (paid art). I don't take requests. Sorry. Art is a
                                luxury, not a necessity; I am not obligated to accept.</li>
                            <li>If you saw a style in my gallery that you do not see listed here, you are welcome to ask if I
                                would be willing.</li>
                            <li>I expect to be provided with references of the character(s), a brief description of their
                                personality, and at least a general idea of what you want drawn. Designing a character from
                                description invokes a design fee (see below)</li>
                            <li>My art style is subject to change from one piece to the next.</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for archiving the art once I deliver it to you. I routinely clear out my
                                storage.</li>
                            <li>Finished art will be provided via our main source of communication [Discord/Note/DM, etc.] and
                                your PayPal email. You will receive .JPG/.JPEG file(s) unless you explicitly state that you
                                require an image with transparency (.PNG). Emotes will be sent as .PNG files.</li>
                            <li>I reserve the right to artistic freedom & interpretation.</li>
                            <li>I usually provide a WIP at the sketch, flat colors, and background flats stages.</li>
                            <li>You can ask for changes during the WIP stages, however, there are limits. I will charge you for
                                extensive revisions (see below). If I have made an error due to misinterpreting poor references
                                or unclear/incomplete descriptions, I am not required to make corrections. Be clear with your
                                requests and make sure everything is in the price quote I send to you.</li>
                            <li>Sketch stage: corrections for blatant errors/missing items | Flat colors stage: corrections for
                                smaller details (like accessories or incorrect base colors | Background flat stage: corrections
                                for color ONLY.</li>
                            <li>If I'm unsure of what you want, I'll doodle out a stick figure sketch, and if you like it, we'll
                                work from there.</li>
                            <li>Please don't waste my time. Do not expect me to re-draw entire scenes for free after you approve
                                of the initial sketch - I will charge you for extensive revisions based on what was completed
                                and what you ask me to draw. For example, if you ask me for a colored sketch scene where two
                                characters are sitting back to back, I doodle them out (you give me the green light to continue
                                working), complete the sketch in its entirety, and then you ask me to draw those same characters
                                in a completely different pose or angle, I will offer to either continue working with the first
                                sketch towards the colored sketch goal, or redraw the whole scene & color it, but you will need
                                to pay for the initial sketch and for the colored sketch as they will be considered two separate
                                drawings. Small changes, like facial expressions, are fine as long as they happen before I start
                                adding color, and, as long as you don't abuse my good will.</li>
                            <li>Avoid uploading the unwatermarked versions publicly (where anyone may access it) if you don't
                                want them stolen/reposted by randoms. Unless a commission is strictly private (see below), I reserve
                                the right to post a full resolution (albeit watermarked) to a VIP discord channel for my Twitch
                                Subscribers.</li>
                            <li>Do not rush or harass me. Please. I have a life outside of drawing commissions. If you have not heard
                                from me in 7 days, you are welcome to inquire about what's going on.</li>
                            <li>Tips are always welcomed & appreciated uwu</li>

                            Additional Fees & Commercial Use
                        </h4>

                            <li>RUSH/PRIORITY: If you have a deadline (e.g., birthday/Valentines/Christmas gift), tell me; there is a
                                25% minimum fee for strict deadlines - the less time you give me, the higher the %fee will be.</li>
                            <li>If there is a queue, and you'd like to skip it (birthday/holiday gift/etc), there is a 25% flat fee
                                for skipping, however this order will not be rushed.</li>
                            <li>If you insist that I design a character from description, there is a 10-50% design fee, depending on
                                complexity. Anything not explicitly described is entirely up to me. I strongly suggest opting for the
                                doodle option when designing characters - while I do not allow edits on doodles, it will still be by far
                                cheaper than having me make edits to a more complex style.</li>
                            <li>If you want your commission to be strictly private (permanently kept off all my social media & out of
                                my VIP discord channel for Twitch Subscribers), please inform me; there is a 100% extra fee depending on
                                your commission. Yes, it will double the total cost of your commission.</li>
                            <li>Lewd art costs extra, depending on what's being shown. Please ask.</li>
                            <li>You are NOT permitted to sell, edit/modify, distribute, make merchandise, claim credit, or use my
                                artwork for advertising (e.g. commercial usage). You ARE permitted to share my art on your social media
                                if you credit/tag me. All artworks are personal use only unless formally discussed prior to me sending
                                the invoice. Commercial work (including but not limited to logos, banners, etc.) invokes a fee, and upon
                                request, you will be provided with a formal document handing over the IP rights at the completion of the
                                commission. I will retain the right to provide my work as samples to future clients. Twitch/Discord
                                emotes are an exception, in which you are permitted to have them as Twitch subscriber rewards/benefits -
                                the other rules mentioned earlier in this clause still apply.</li>
                            <li>You may post the art I create for you on your (personal) website/blog/social media, as long as you
                                link or tag one or more of my social media to it in some manner. You may not use it as part of an
                                advertisement or in any way that will bring you income (exception is Twitch/Discord emotes, but please
                                still credit me).</li>

                            <li>Listed prices are "minimum", base for simple character designs and poses; it's how much you would pay
                                for your character in a plain T-shirt + pants + basic shoes in an idle position of my choice. I adjust
                                prices for intricate designs & positions.</li>
                            <li>Character props like weapons/pets/accessories/plushies cost extra. Price depends on style & complexity
                                of the item(s).</li>
                            <li>Commissions totaling $75.99 and below require full payment up front. If your commission is $76.00 or
                                more, you can request the half payment method instead.</li>
                            <li>You must pay half of (or full) price up front. PayPal Only. Half payment will result in watermarked
                                ("Work in progress, not paid in full"), lower resolution previews/WIPs. This is to deter ghosting &
                                theft.</li>
                            <li>You have 48 hours to respond to me after I (attempt to) contact you that it's your turn in queue. If
                                you do not have the funds to proceed, you may ask to cancel or be put on hold while I move onto another
                                person. I will approach you again after that person's commission is completed. This process can be
                                repeated indefinitely until you're the only person left in queue, at which point it will be your
                                responsibility to contact me once you're ready.</li>
                            <li>You have 48 hours to make a payment after I send the invoice.</li>
                            <li>If after 48 hours I do not receive payment or an update from you, I will cancel your commission.</li>
                            <li>Please do not send payment until after I accept your commission. Any and all payments sent without my
                                prior knowledge (and our mutual agreement) will be deemed as donations.</li>
                            <li>Prices are non-negotiable; do not ask me to adjust them to your budget. I always break down my pricing
                                for more complex commissions, so if something's too expensive, you can remove specific portions.</li>
                            <li>If you think my price is unfair & believe I can finish your art for a cheaper price, you can request
                                to pay 'by the hour', in which I set a timer that activates only when I draw. Please contact me for more
                                details.</li>
                            <li>You may cancel only if you have not sent payment yet. Absolutely no refunds unless I cancel (at any
                                point) from my end.</li>
                            <li>Unless your commission is strictly private, I reserve the right to display your commission in my
                                social media/website/gallery/etc. and to make possible future profit off of your commission - e.g.,
                                artbooks/prints/advertising my art/Twitch/Social Media etc.</li>

                                Freelancer taxes in my area also cut off a good 35%-40% of my earnings.</li>
